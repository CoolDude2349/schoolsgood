Here are the steps to view your school work:

1. If you havent been to the github page before, close chrome, turn off your internet connection, go back to chrome, go to the website, turn it back on, and if you see a glimpse of the blue button before it being blocked, then it worked.
2. Now you can view the button offline. Go back to the website while offline.
3. Now this step is very important: Turn your wifi back on and immediately click the button. Since the blockers only work online and offline when initialized (which they didn't), they will start to run as you turn on wifi.
4. If you are redirected to the other page, go back to the button page and click it again. Keep doing this until the blockers block the website, or when the content in one of the other tabs loads normally.
5. And that's it.


Now you can load up your school work. 

You have to do steps 3 and 4 because this script uses a CDN. It's not like the other html file in the schoolsawsome repo where you just upload a file. We are using an external script instead.
